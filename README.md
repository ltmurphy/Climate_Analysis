# Climate_Analysis: SurfsUp_Challenge
Climate data retrieval and analysis

# Analysis Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to gather temperature statistics for the months of June and December in order to assess the viability of running a surf/ice-cream shop year around. Two separate queries are made, one for each month. The tuple was then split into lists which were then converted to dataframes. Each temperature dataframe was then called for each month.

# Results

 -- In June we had a total count of 1700, mean of 74.9, min of 64.0 and max of 85.0

 -- In December we had a total count of 1517, mean of 71.0, min of 56.0 and max of 83.0

 -- Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75

# Summary 

The data shows little overall variation from June to December. Both months have similar means and maxes. There is slightly larger variation between the minimum temperature but not enough to influence the overall decision. Based of this data alone a combination ice-cream/surf shop would be profitable year round as the temperature will not fluctuate enough to influence customers. However, this is only temperature data. Other data, such as precipitation, would provide a clearer picture of what the future could hold. Gathering this data for the other months would be worthwhile also. The effort would be minimal but the benefits could be tremendous. This bigger picture would help reveal any hidden pitfalls and allow a customized business plan to maximize profit efficiency.
